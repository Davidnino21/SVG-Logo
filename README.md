# SVG Logo Maker 

## Description
Created a Logo generator that allows users to create their own unique logo. The user will have the option to select a circle, triangle, or a square. The user will also have the option for the text color and shape color. 

## User Story
As a user I want to be able to create a logo using the command-line. The command-line will prompt the user with a series of questions with text, text-color, shape, and shape-color. Once the user has answered all the question a logo will be created.
